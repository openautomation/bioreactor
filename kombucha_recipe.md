# Kombucha Recipe (makes approximately 1L)
We are forking the Noisebridge [kombucha recipe](https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Kombucha_Brewing_Manual). Below is our current state of the art:

## Ingredients
* 1000mL water (preferrably filtered and free of chlorine)
* 60g cane sugar
* 6g tea leaves
* 50mL starter culture
* 1x SCOBY

## Instructions
1. Wash everything which is going to come into contact with the kombucha. Seriously. You're planning to drink this, aren't you?
2. Bring 1000mL water to a boil (alternatively, use less than 1000mL at this step and then dilute it to the appropriate volume later) 
3. Add tea leaves and steep for at least 5 minutes
4. Strain the tea to remove all leaves
5. Dissolve sugar (if you made a concentrated solution at step 2, this would be a good time to add the remaining water)
6. Wait for the tea to cool to at least body temperature
7. Add starter and SCOBY to the fermentation vessel
8. Make sure to cover the mouth of the vessel to prevent contamination (cloth and rubber bands work very well for this)
